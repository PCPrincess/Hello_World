Recruitment [Chat]

Recruiting open for 'Hello World', a new guild on Staghelm. The guild is dedicated to those of us who are passionate about computing and coding. While enthusiasm for computers and development is a main focus, it is not the only one. One of our main tenents will be to bring the 'social' aspect back to MMO gaming. We play to have fun and gather with like-minded individuals. Please PM for an invite if you are interested.
